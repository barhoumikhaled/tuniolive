    title: "Our Heritage",
    paragraph1: `Our journey begins with Sadok — orphaned young, inheriting a modest plot in Kairouan.
                Through grit, perseverance, and deep respect for the land, he cleared scrub, planted olive trees,
                and nurtured a vision. To sustain his family, he first grew melons, watermelons, peppers, and
                other produce. Over decades, his modest plot transformed into a flourishing estate of hundreds
                of olive trees.`,
    paragraph2: `Today, the family carries Sadok’s legacy forward. Rooted in Kairouan soil, we nurture
                centuries-old olive varieties and share them with the world — with pride, authenticity, and
                uncompromising quality.`,
